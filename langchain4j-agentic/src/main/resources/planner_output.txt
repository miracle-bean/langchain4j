Since the user's request is about a broken leg, which is a medical issue, the 'medical' agent should handle it. The 'askToExpert' was already used to categorize it as medical. Now that we know it's medical, we should call the medical agent to get the appropriate advice. The other agents (technical and legal) aren't relevant here. So the correct invocation is the medical agent with the user's request as the argument.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n{\n  \"agentName\": \"medical\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"userRequest\": \"I broke my leg what should I do\"\n  }\n}"},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":32326334699,"load_duration":12805117,"prompt_eval_count":594,"prompt_eval_duration":13516328624,"eval_count":190,"eval_duration":18777226686}

The last response is empty, so no previous answer.\n\nFirst, I need to determine which agent to call. The user's request is about a medical issue—breaking a leg. The medical agent is described as a medical expert, so that's relevant. But wait, there's also the askToExpert agent, which categorizes the user request. Should I use that first?\n\nWait, the instructions say to query all necessary agents. But maybe the askToExpert agent is for determining which expert to consult. Let me think. The user's question is straightforward: they need medical advice. The medical agent can directly answer. However, maybe the askToExpert agent is needed to categorize the request to the right expert. But the user's request is already clear. The medical agent can provide the answer directly. However, the askToExpert agent's purpose is to categorize the request. But since the user's request is about a broken leg, which is a medical issue, maybe the medical agent is the right choice. But the instructions say to query all necessary agents. Wait, no, the user might need to first categorize the request. Wait, the askToExpert agent's description says it categorizes the user request. So maybe the first step is to use askToExpert to determine which expert to consult. But the user's request is already clear. However, the instructions say to never take shortcuts and to query all necessary agents. Wait, the user's request is to decide which agent to invoke next. The available agents include medical and askToExpert. Since the user's request is a medical issue, the medical agent is the correct one. But maybe the askToExpert agent is needed to determine the category. Wait, the askTo expect agent's purpose is to categorize the request. So perhaps the first step is to use askToExpert to determine which expert (like medical) is needed. But the user's request is already about a broken leg, which is medical. So maybe the medical agent is the correct one to call directly. However, the instructions say to query all necessary agents. Wait, the user might need to first categorize the request. But the user's request is explicit. The medical agent can answer directly. So the correct agent is medical. But the askToExpert agent is for categorizing. Since the user's request is clear, maybe the medical agent is the right choice. But the instructions say to query all necessary agents. Wait, maybe the askToExpert agent is needed to determine which expert to consult. So first, use askToExpert to categorize the request, then use the medical agent. But the user's request is already clear. However, the instructions say to do things in small steps and not take shortcuts. So perhaps the first step is to use askToExpert to categorize the request. Let me check the agent descriptions again. The askToExpert agent's description is \"An agent that categorizes the user request\". So if the user's request is about a broken leg, the askToExpert agent would categorize it as medical. Then, the next step would be to call the medical agent. But the user's request is already clear. However, the instructions say to query all necessary agents. Wait, the user's request is to decide which agent to invoke next. The available agents are medical, technical, legal, and askToExpert.

The user's request is \"I broke my leg what should I do\". The medical agent can directly answer. So the correct agent is medical. But the instructions say to query all necessary agents.

Then, based on the categorization, call the appropriate agent. But the user's request is already clear. However, the instructions say to never take shortcuts. So the correct approach is to first use askToExpert to categorize the request. Therefore, the agent to call next is askToExpert with the user's request as the argument.
