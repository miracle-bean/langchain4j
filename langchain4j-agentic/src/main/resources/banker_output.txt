So the answer might be that the transfer can't be done directly, but the user might need to use two agents. But the user's request is to transfer, so maybe the correct approach is to first withdraw from Mario's account and then credit Georgios's. But the user's request is a single transfer. However, the available agents don't have a transfer function. So the correct answer is to use the withdraw agent for Mario's account and then the credit agent for Georgios's. But the user's request is to transfer, which isn't directly possible. Wait, the user's request is to transfer 100 from Mario to Georgios. The available agents are credit and withdraw. So the correct steps would be to first withdraw 100 from Mario's account (using the withdraw agent) and then credit Georgios's account (using the credit agent). But the user's request is a single transfer. However, since the agents don't have a transfer function, the answer would be to use both agents. But the user's request is to transfer, so maybe the correct answer is to use the withdraw agent on Mario's account and then the credit agent on Georgios's. But the user's request is a single action. However, the available agents don't have a transfer function. Therefore, the correct approach is to first withdraw from Mario's account and then credit Georgios's. But the user's request is to transfer, which isn't directly supported. So the answer would be to use the withdraw agent for Mario's account and then the credit agent for Georgios's. But the user's request is to transfer, so the correct answer is to use the withdraw agent on Mario's account and then the credit agent on Georgios's. Therefore, the first step is to withdraw 100 from Mario's account using the withdraw agent. Then, the next step would be to credit Georgios's account with 100 using the credit agent. But the user's request is a single transfer. However, the available agents don't have a transfer function. So the correct answer is to use the withdraw agent first and then the credit agent.
